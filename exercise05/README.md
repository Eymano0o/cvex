Exercise 05: Camara Calibration 
================================

Files
-----

Each file contains a single
matlab function doing exactly 
one task. For Documentation, see
files.

calc_cam_angles.m
calc_eq_matrix.m
calc_rotation.m
calc_translation.m
get_corners.m
main.m
scale_h_matrix.m
scale_im_coord.m
solve_eq.m

Execution
---------

Can be executed using Matlab (everything was tested
on the pool PCs):

> main(imagefilename)


Remarks
-------

Results look reasonable, though cam height (z coordinates)
seems to be negative. Maybe some wrong sign.
